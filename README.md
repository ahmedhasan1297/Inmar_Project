# Inmar_Project
The project is developed for contact managements. The modules are developed using HTML, JQUERY, ANGULAR JS, CSS and PHP. The PHP is for the server side and the remaining are for the client side. As the PHP is easy to learn and use, I choosed it as the server side programing.

## Getting Started

The XAMPP server is used in the project. The source files/folders are placed in the htdocs folder of the XAMPP folder. The server should be started before opening the file on the browser. The url of the source file should be like 'localhost/folder_name/file_name'. The localhost is given because the PC is acting both as the client and the server.  

### Prerequisites
//What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
The XAMPP is needed to execute. so install XAMPP SERVER in your machine
The browser is needed to run the HTML file.
The database should be created in the server(my database name is contacts_management). Many number of relations can be created in the database that are used for the application. Each project can have a different database.

```
